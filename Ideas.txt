A few melodramatic words to begin with so that you know that the following story is very, very enormous:

Madmen are ruling the world while THREATS are approaching that nobody is prepared for. Kids are playing IN the park having no idea what might BE coming from the sky.
But you know it better.

But bringing weapons into the game often has UNFORESEEABLE CONSEQUENCES. Can we as a species defend ourselves? Our children?
